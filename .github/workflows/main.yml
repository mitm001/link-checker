# This action will check for broken links in the supplied repository branch
# (gh-pages). The link-checker action can be configured to execute on a schedule
# and/or open an issue when a problem is found.
#
# We write an LINKCHECKER_OUTPUT_FILENAME file to the LINKCHECKER_OUTPUT_DIR.
# This file can be searched for "ERROR", or in the case of images and files,
# "no such file or directory". This info can be used to search in the supplied
# repository for the broken link. It is not able to verify relative links beyond
# the case that the target page exists.
#
# Antora will set a class="page unresolved" in the HREF attribute for any
# relative link that is not valid so we use the grep command to check for this
# class, and if found, write out the line to file using the environment variable
# OUTPUT_FILE. This line can then be used to locate the broken link in the
# supplied repository.
#
# The Antora UI inserts links into the header of every page, one for editing a
# page and one for navigating to the wiki repository. We use a regex to filter
# out these as they tend to trigger "Too Many Requests (HTTP error 429)".
