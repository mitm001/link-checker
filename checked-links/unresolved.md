tutorials/concepts/math.html:986:<p>It&#8217;s a fact of life, math is hard. Unfortunately, 3D graphics require a fair bit of knowledge about the subject. Fortunately, jME is able to hide the majority of the details away from the user. Vectors are the fundamental type in the 3D environment, and it is used extensively. Matrices are also a basic necessity of 3D for representing linear systems. <a href="#xref:core:math/quaternion.adoc" class="page unresolved">Quaternions</a> are perhaps the most powerful and complicated of the basic types and are used for rotation in jME.</p>

contributions/tools/charts.html:998:<p>About the <a href="#jme3/tools/navigation.adoc" class="page unresolved">Navigation package</a>.</p>
contributions/tools/charts.html:1035:<p>In essence, 3D chart visualization is achieved by converting the polygons composing planet earth&#8217;s landmass into float matrices whereby each value within the matrix represents a specific terrain height. For example, given a terrain of 100 x 100 world units, we construct a heightmap by creating a 100 x 100 matrix. Each cell within the matrix corresponds to a terrain coordinate; each cell’s value to that coordinate’s desired height. But you already knew that, so where&#8217;s the tricky part? Well, when visualizing a chart an accurate projection requires a translation of latitude/longitude coordinates into their equivalent world unit (x,y,z) counterparts. This translation however is not a straight forward mapping of one coordinate system into the other due to the distortion arising from projecting an oblate spheroid onto a flat surface (see my previous wiki article <a href="#jme3/tools/navigation.adoc" class="page unresolved">here</a>). This means that if one would adhere to a linear scale, the Mercator projection would distort the size and shape of objects as the object distances itself from the equator, eventually resulting in infinite scaling as the pole is reached. So the first task at hand, is to construct accurate 2D projections of planet earth which we can then use as heightmaps. We can achieve this using the jme3.tools.navigation package and co-ordinate sets available at <a href="https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/geophysics/">noaa.gov</a>.</p>
contributions/tools/charts.html:1038:<p>As <a href="#jme3/tools/navigation.adoc" class="page unresolved">previously discussed</a>, the distortion in latitude is derived by using the difference in meridional parts between the chart’s centre and the current position as a baseline; through converting the difference to world units by dividing it by the number of world units contained within one minute, a latitude’s y-coordinate can be obtained. Calculating a position’s x-coordinate is somewhat easier as the distortion only applies to latitude, not longitude. Therefore x merely equals the sum or difference between itself and the viewport’s centre coordinate, depending on the relative location of the position itself and the chart’s centre. Despite being able to convert between the two coordinate systems, slight precision problems remain once the chart projection is scaled down past a level of 6 meters. This is caused by the pixel referencing system of modern displays being integer based; once the ratio of minutes to pixels exceeds the aforementioned threshold, slight inaccuracies are introduced into the display. However this is of little relevance to most GIS (such as Debrief) as a) the inaccuracies are a matter of meters (or even centimetres) and b) it is impossible to notice this variation as GPS exposes a much higher inaccuracy (between 10 - 100 meters).</p>

core/scene/spatial.html:1110:<p><strong>Shapes:</strong> The simplest type of Meshes are jME&#8217;s default <a href="#jme3/advanced/shape.adoc" class="page unresolved">Shape</a>s such as cubes and spheres. You can use several Shapes to build complex Geometries. Shapes are built-in and can be created without using the AssetManager.</p>
core/scene/spatial.html:1113:<p><strong>3D Models:</strong> <a href="#jme3/advanced/3d_models.adoc" class="page unresolved">3D models and scenes</a> are also made up of meshes, but are more complex than Shapes. You create Models and Scenes in external 3D Mesh Editors and export them as Ogre XML or Wavefront OBJ. Use the <a href="../asset/asset_manager.html" class="page">Asset Manager</a> to load models into a your jME3 game.</p>
core/scene/spatial.html:1127:<p>Cloned spatials share the same mesh, while each cloned spatial can have its own local transformation (translation, rotation, and scale) in the scene. This means you only use <code>clone()</code> on spatials whose meshes never change. The most common use case for cloning is when you use several Spatials that are based on the same <a href="#jme3/advanced/shape.adoc" class="page unresolved">Shape</a>s (e.g. trees, crates).</p>

core/collision/collision_and_intersection.html:989:<p>Non-physical collision detection is interesting because it uses less computing resources than physical collision detection. The non-physical calculations are faster because they do not have any side effects such as pushing other objects or bumping off of them. Tasks such as <a href="#jme3/advanced/mouse_picking.adoc" class="page unresolved">mouse picking</a> are easily implemented using mathematical techniques such as ray casting and intersections.  Experienced developers optimize their games by finding ways to simulate certain (otherwise expensive physical) interactions in a non-physical way.</p>

core/effect/water.html:986:<p>jMonkeyEngine offers a SimpleWaterProcessor that turns any quad (flat rectangle) into a reflective water surface with waves. You can use this quad for simple limited water surfaces such as water troughs, shallow fountains, puddles, shallow water in channels. The SimpleWaterProcessor has less performance impact on your game than the full featured <a href="#jme3/advanced/post-processor_water.adoc" class="page unresolved">SeaMonkey WaterFilter</a>; the main difference is that the SimpleWaterProcessor does not include under-water effects.</p>
