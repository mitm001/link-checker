core/scene/mesh.html:1032:<p>Use built-in <a href="#jme3/advanced/shape.adoc" class="page unresolved">Shape</a>s as meshes;</p>
core/scene/spatial.html:1113:<p><strong>Shapes:</strong> The simplest type of Meshes are jME&#8217;s default <a href="#jme3/advanced/shape.adoc" class="page unresolved">Shape</a>s such as cubes and spheres. You can use several Shapes to build complex Geometries. Shapes are built-in and can be created without using the AssetManager.</p>
core/scene/spatial.html:1116:<p><strong>3D Models:</strong> <a href="#jme3/advanced/3d_models.adoc" class="page unresolved">3D models and scenes</a> are also made up of meshes, but are more complex than Shapes. You create Models and Scenes in external 3D Mesh Editors and export them as Ogre XML or Wavefront OBJ. Use the <a href="../asset/asset_manager.html" class="page">Asset Manager</a> to load models into a your jME3 game.</p>
core/scene/spatial.html:1130:<p>Cloned spatials share the same mesh, while each cloned spatial can have its own local transformation (translation, rotation, and scale) in the scene. This means you only use <code>clone()</code> on spatials whose meshes never change. The most common use case for cloning is when you use several Spatials that are based on the same <a href="#jme3/advanced/shape.adoc" class="page unresolved">Shape</a>s (e.g. trees, crates).</p>
core/scene/3d_models.html:990:<p>Like <a href="#jme3/advanced/shape.adoc" class="page unresolved">Shape</a>s, 3D models are also made up of <a href="mesh.html" class="page">Mesh</a>es, but models are more complex than Shapes. While Shapes are built into jME3, you typically create models in external 3D Mesh Editors.</p>

core/collision/collision_and_intersection.html:992:<p>Non-physical collision detection is interesting because it uses less computing resources than physical collision detection. The non-physical calculations are faster because they do not have any side effects such as pushing other objects or bumping off of them. Tasks such as <a href="#mouse_picking.adoc" class="page unresolved">mouse picking</a> are easily implemented using mathematical techniques such as ray casting and intersections.  Experienced developers optimize their games by finding ways to simulate certain (otherwise expensive physical) interactions in a non-physical way.</p>
