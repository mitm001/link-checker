jme3/advanced/update_loop.html:437:<p> <a href="#tutorials:jme3/intermediate/simpleapplication.adoc" class="page unresolved">com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication</a> provides you with an update loop. This is where you implement your game logic (game mechanics).</p>
jme3/advanced/update_loop.html:507:<p>In a trivial <a href="../intermediate/simpleapplication.html" class="page">SimpleApplication</a> (such as a <a href="#tutorials:beginner.adoc" class="page unresolved">Hello World tutorial</a>), all code is either in the <code>simpleInitApp()</code> (initialization) or <code>simpleUpdate()</code> (behaviour) method â€“ or in a helper method/class that is called from one of these two. This trivial approach will make your main class very long, hard to read, and hard to maintain. You don&#8217;t need to load the whole scene at once, and you don&#8217;t need to run all conditionals tests all the time.</p>
